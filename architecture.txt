two subsystems

ss1: the workers
        
ss2: the dispatcher
    

Definitions:
    Job : pbs job -> one call to qsub/msub
    Node : One physical machine
    Process : One worker instance

    New word of ours : Training Task -> potentially multi job single nn training endeavour


The dispatcher shouldn't be on the entry node. The dispatcher should be somewhere else. The problem with that is that it is an additionnal barrier to entry.


Dispatcher need to know a stopping criterion. should probably be execution time.


What should be on the sql server:
    PK: training task id
        -> job ids

    FK: job id
        -> task id

    FK: proc id
        -> id
        -> pid
        -> state
        -> Node
        -> Port
        -> job id

    FK: NODE
        -> ip
