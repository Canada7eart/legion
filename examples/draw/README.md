The original project is JÃ¶rg Bornschein's draw implementation.

    https://github.com/jbornschein/draw

This was forked and the main training script was adapted to work with Legion.
See https://github.com/gyom/draw for Guillaume Alain's fork.

The legion-train-draw.py file was adapted from the train-draw.py script
and it contains everything that is required to run this with Legion on Helios.
